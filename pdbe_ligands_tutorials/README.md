# PDBe Tools for Ligand Analysis and Visualisation

Welcome to the **PDBe Tools for Ligand Analysis and Visualisation** repository! This repository provides tutorials and resources to help researchers parse, analyse and visualise ligand data using various PDBe tools. The tutorials included here cover a range of PDBe tools specifically designed to work with small molecule data, offering comprehensive guidance on identifying, enriching, and interpreting ligand structures and their interactions.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes three main tutorials, each focusing on a unique aspect of ligand analysis and visualisation using PDBe tools.

### Tutorials

1. **Tutorial 1: PDBe Ligand Tools**  
   A comprehensive guide on using various PDBe tools for processing and analysing ligand structure data in PDB, covering:
   - **PDBe CCDUtils** - For accessing and enriching ligand data. 
   - **PDBe Arpeggio** - For identifying interactions between ligands and macromolecules.  
   - **PDBe RelLig** - For identifying the functional roles of ligands in the PDB entries they are bound.
